DONE 1. Use SQLite or MySQL to store real time data in a database
DONE 2. Create two endpoints (/weather_conditions & /traffic_intensity)
DONE 3. For two endpoints return averages of numeric metrics (temperature, wind speed, number of vehicles) for a given period
DONE 4. API endpoints should acccept the id or multiple ids of the device and the period for which to calculate the averages
DONE 5. Accepting ids and the period for a given period
DONE 6. Think of a mechanism to store data from real time API's in a database
DONE 7. Read about pull data from real time API (look for the best)
DONE 8. Create and use Docker
DONE 9. Create job that is running each hour which questions whether there is any new data that you ingest into your database. Otherwise you don't do anything and just go with what you have
DONE 10. Create a script for cronjob that queries real-time APIs
DONE 11. Basically programs will have two functionalities: a script that takes data and stores that into database and second that is an API that returns the required values to the user
DONE 12. Make a data nodel
DONE 13. Make small function from big ones
DONE 14. Make tests
DONE 15. Include Marshmallow for validations
Done 16. Create/Update README
NICE TO DO TO IMPROVE 17. Implement MySQL instead of SQLite
