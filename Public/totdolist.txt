DONE1. Use SQLite or MySQL to store real time data in a database
2. Create two endpoints (/weather_conditions & /traffic_intensity)
3. For two endpoints return averages of numeric metrics (temperature, wind speed, number of vehicles) for a given period
4. API endpoints should acccept the id or multiple ids of the device and the period for which to calculate the averages
5. Accepting ids and the period for a given period
DONE 6. Think of a mechanism to store data from real time API's in a database
DONE 7. Read about pull data from real time API (look for the best)
8. Create and use Docker with MySQL
9-10. Creat job that is running ~10 mins which questions whether there is any new data that you ingest into your database. Otherwise you don't do anything and just go with what you have
9-10. Create a script for cronjob that queries real-time APIs
11. Use the front end for visualisations (optional because I want)
12. Basically you'll have programs with two functionalities: a script that takes data and stores that into database and second that is an API that returns the required values to the user
DONE 13. Reikia duoemnu bazes i ka storinti ir duomenu modelio (pora lenteliu) kaip matosi
DONE 14. Make a data nodel (pasidaryk duomenu modeli kuri reikia)
15. Sukurti script'a paziureti kaip daznai jie ikelia juos (reikia checkpoint'a tureti kaip paskutinis ikelimas buvo vakar, etc) CRON JOB
16. Dirbk su SQLite pirma ir sukurus viska veikiancio tada pabandyk implementuoti ir MySQL.
